## Machine Learning for the Detection of In-hospital Deterioration on Hospital Wards



This repository includes code from Farah Shamout's DPhil titled "Machine Learning for the Detection of Clinical Deterioration on Hospital Wards" completed at the University of Oxford. 



The work involves three types of models:

- Threshold-based Early Warning Score
- Deep Interpretable Early Warning Score
- Multi-modal Early Warning Score 



Steps to run the code:

- create_dummy_dataset.py in datasets folder- this script generates a dummy dataset of the most routinely collected vital signs (HR, SBP, SPO2, TEMP, AVPU, & masktype). masktype indicates the provision of supplemental oxygen

- navigate to the score of interest and run its respective scripts

  

*Note that this repository will be constantly updated and is not final yet...*
